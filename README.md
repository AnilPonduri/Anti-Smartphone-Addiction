# Anti-Smartphone-Addiction
This app is very simple and gives notification and vibration to get distracted from your phone.


For my project I chose to create an anti smartphone addiction application. This is going to be an application that will help people avoid getting too addicted to their smartphones. Smartphone addiction, also known as nomophobia, is a real problem that people face nowadays. This addiction manifests itself in the activities that people partake in on their smartphones; including texting, browsing the internet, consuming media and making phone calls among others.

My mobile application will keep track of the length of time  a user spends interacting with certain applications. The user will then be presented with data showing how much time they spent on the applications and they can allocate time restrictions, after the time restrictions have been set, my application will notify them whenever the time restrictions for individual applications have been exceeded. The user can choose whether to allow my application to forcefully shut down the application that has been overused for the day.

I chose this project because this is something I struggle with myself. I am not too addicted to my smartphone but I acknowledge that I spend more time than I would really like. This is time I could use to be productive.

I will be targeting the android platform because it is the most popular. I will use the android studio IDE because it is the officially recognized and recommended way to build android applications. I will use the Java programming language together with Kotlin.
